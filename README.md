# File-Compressor-Decompressor-using-Huffman-principle


The File Compressor-Decompressor is a command line tool which is built on Huffman coding and decoding priciple. 
The purpose of this project is to help others for their coding practices in the implementation of recursion algorithm which can become as tricky as possible.

The project is developed using Java.
It is also a good guide for dealing with any kind of file format operations as it uses BufferedStream and FileStream to read files. 
There is no constraint on the file format for the compressing-decompressing, in almost every case the compression rate is nearly 40%.
